<br>
Welcome to the ADA-PARC website. The ADA-PARC is a collaborative research project of 7 Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) Regional Centers.
<br>
#### Purpose of ADA-PARC
The ADA-PARC research has four purposes:
1. **To look at participation disparities** experienced by people with disabilities post ADA & Olmstead
2. **To identify & examine key environmental factors** contributing to these disparities
3. **To benchmark participation disparities and highlight promising practices** at state & city levels
4. **To action-plan strategies for dissemination and utilization of findings** to be used by ADA Centers and others in community capacity building & systems change initiatives
<br>
#### The Work of the ADA-PARC
The ADA-PARC has research teams focused on Community Living, Community Participation & Work/Economic Participation measures and uses Regional Steering Committees in each of the seven participating regions to gather, review, and choose appropriate data to achieve the project's purposes. The data are mainly from national data sources that have enough statistical power to be relevant on the local level.
The intent of this effort is to use this information to inform:
1. ADA Center technical assistance and resource dissemination, and
2. Community level stakeholders to increase participation opportunities in their communities.
<br>
#### Who is the ADA-PARC
The seven participating ADA-Regional Centers in the ADA-PARC are:
- Region 6 Southwest ADA Center: Lex Frieden, Co-Project Director
- Region 5 Great Lakes ADA Center: Joy Hammel, Co-Project Director, Community Participation data team lead
- Region 9 Pacific ADA Center: Lewis Kraus, Community Living data team lead
- Region 4 Southeast ADA Center: Katie McDonald, Work & Economics data team lead
- Region 8 Rocky Mountain ADA Center: Bob Gattis
- Region 3 Mid-Atlantic ADA Center: Marian Vessels
- Region 10 Great Northwest ADA Center: Kathe Matrone
<br>
#### About this Website
The ADA-PARC website is a collection of public data sets that can help shed light on the status of people with disabilities in local communities. The data includes national, state, county, and city data. In addition to Demographic data describing the population, the three main areas of data to illuminate the status of disability in an area are: Community Living, Community Participation and Work & Economics. Each of the three areas presents data in map form as well as in tabular form. A summary of what is important about the data is presented on each page. The data source is described along with the calculation to arrive at the values used in the tables and maps. Data is first presented by state, and then if available, at county and city level.
